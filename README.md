# health-check
Scripts that help to check the health of my computers.
In this project we provide lots of fancy checks which are responsible for to check the health of computers.
Currently, the main script or source code of this project is in health_checks.py file.

After successful execution of this script, either of the following messages should appear on the screen. 
1. This script will print "Everything ok" if all checks pass, OR
2. The corresponding error messages if some check fail.

Here, I would like to request all developers please come forward and contribute to open source.
Every small contribution is worth it and counted.
